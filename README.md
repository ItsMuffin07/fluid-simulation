Simple fluid simulation by Jayden Fung
---------------------------------------
This is an Eulerian fluid simulation which utilises a 2D grid-based plane to simulate the flow of an
incompressible, inviscid fluid. To use this simulation, modify parameters within the scene dictionary
and the setup_scene() function.

Keybinds:
p : Show pressure field
m : Show smoke field
v : Show velocity field
+ or = : Increase amount of arrows in velocity field
- : Decrease amount of arrows in velocity field
[ : Decrease arrow size in velocity field
] : Increase arrow size in velocity field
